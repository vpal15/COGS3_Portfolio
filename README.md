Thank you!

How I chose my projects:
The projects I chose showcase both my design abilities, and my understanding of technology contracting work.
I have spent quite some time working with small businesses who are exploring how tech innovations (like cloud computing, data recovery, and disaster preperations) can help transform their productivity. 
In my projects, you will find a review video which has proven to be an effective onboarding material for potential clients.
Additionally, there is an entry-level lead conversion packet that highlights the design concepts I have integrated to make lead conversion less expensive and more effective. 
I chose to include my studyBuddy, Dice Lab, and HappyHeart projects to serve as a basis for my ever-growing programming abilities. In the technical market I am in, it is crucial to have a programming background, regardless of the specialty I occupy. 
Such projects have shaped my ability not only for designing materials for improved client relations, but also to better catering to specific audiences. 

My process:
Projects like the conversion packet were designed to attract attention without distracting from the overarching message. 
For simplicity, the color pallette reflects that of my company's brand. However the graphics themselves were designed to stand out in the background to create a more visually appealing experience. Conversion packets are only ever effective if they are memorable!
A similar idea was used to create the review video. To keep viewers engaged, I included the constant movement in the background, but used a looped video to avoid overloading the viewers with too much stimulation in the back. 
HappyHeart was designed with complementary colors, since these palettes are often the most vibrant and tend to stand out more. The use of blue in most of the backgrounds was to counteract the red of the heart images, while maintaining the complementary color scheme. 
I used muted tones in studyBuddy and the Dice Lab since the focus of these projects is the content itself. The dice already stand out in the game, as they are the largest object in the screen, so bright colors would have clashed and looked tacky. Similarly in studyBuddy, there are small pops of color to highlight major sections of the webpage (like pricing), but everything else is muted so that the studyBuddy program itself takes the main control and only the features are highlighted to the viewer.
